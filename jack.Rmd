$\bf Theorem$$22$

$\bf Claim:$ There are natural numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

$\it Proof:$ There exist a, b, c$\in N$ with $a +b >= c$. since the $\sqrt{c^2-b^2} = a$ and $\sqrt{c^2-a^2} = b$ 





$\bf Theorem$$29$.

$\bf Claim:$ No natural number is both even and odd.

$\it Proof:$ $a\neq b$, if $a$ is even, then a cannot be odd. If $b$ is odd then it cannot be even.  Therefore $a$ is even and $b$ is odd.
