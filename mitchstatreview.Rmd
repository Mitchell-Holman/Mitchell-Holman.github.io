## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
me <- 48
me2 <- 43

qnorm(10.6333,sd = 3, lower.tail = TRUE)
qnorm(2)- qnorm(1)
1-pt(1.0,5)
pt(1,5,lower.tail = F)

pnorm(1)- .5

rnorm(1:886, 0,1 )
```

```{r}
r <-pnorm(1:100,48,5)
plot(r)

f <- rnorm(100,0,10)


plot.ts(f)
6
```
```{r}

```


```{r}
dnorm(1:108, mean =1.54, sd=1.98)


```
